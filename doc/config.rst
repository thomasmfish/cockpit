Configuration
*************

.. note::

    Cockpit uses `Microscope <https://python-microscope.org/>`_ to
    handle the hardware level device communication.  This page is
    concerned with the configuration of Cockpit and assumes you
    already have working Microscope device servers.  For more
    information on setting up device servers see `its documentation
    <https://python-microscope.org/doc/architecture/device-server.html>`__.

There are two parts to configuring cockpit.  The :ref:`configuration
of cockpit proper <cockpit-config>` that covers most of cockpit
options, and the :ref:`depot configuration <depot-config>` which lists
all devices that cockpit will have control over.


.. _cockpit-config:

Cockpit Configuration
=====================

Cockpit configuration controls basic behaviour of Cockpit such as
logging level, where to save data as default, and the location of
other configuration files.  In most cases, the default values will be
enough and users will not need to change these.

Config file
-----------

Cockpit configuration file spans multiple sections, each section
having multiple options (see the :ref:`config-file-format` for
details).  For example:

.. code:: ini

  [global]
  data-dir: ~/data
  depot-files: /etc/xdg/cockpit/depot/general.conf
               /etc/xdg/cockpit/depot/local.conf
               /etc/xdg/cockpit/depot/experimental.conf

  [log]
  level: warning
  dir: ~/data/logs

The following sections and their options are recognised:

global section
``````````````

channel-files
  List of files defining channel configurations to be loaded by
  default.  Each file can have any number of channels, later files
  overriding previous channels with the same name.  These files can be
  created via the Channels menu on the menu bar.

config-dir
  Directory for the user configuration file, effectively a cache for
  the last used settings.

data-dir
  Directory for the default location to save image data. This has 
  several path substutution options: `{user}`, `{year}`, `{date}`, 
  and `{time}`, allowing some customisation beyond a static path.


depot-files
  List of files to use for the device depot.  See :ref:`depot-config`.

pyro-pickle-protocol
  Pickle protocol version number to use with Pyro, i.e., when
  connecting to the device server.  Defaults to whatever is already
  set on Pyro which defaults to the highest pickle protocol version
  available.  This affects *all* Pyro connections.

log section
```````````
level
  Threshold level for the messages displayed on both the logging
  window and log files.  Only messages that have a severity level
  equal or higher are displayed.  The severity levels are, by
  increasing order: debug, info, warning, error, and critical.

dir
  Directory to create new log files. This allows the same path
  substututions as data-dir.

stage section
`````````````

primitives

  A list of shapes to draw on stage displays.  Primitives are
  specified by a config entry of the form:

  .. code:: ini

      primitives: c 1000 1000 100
                  r 1000 1000 100 100

  where ``c x0 y0 radius`` defines a circle centred on ``x0, y0`` and
  ``r x0 y0 width height`` defines a rectangle centred on ``x0, y0``.


.. TODO:: These options for the stage section are historical and a
          fudge.  They need to be changed and may be removed in the
          future.

dishAltitude
  Dish altitude.

slideAltitude
  Slide altitude.

slideTouchdownAltitude
  Slide touchdown altitude.

loadPosition
  Load position used in the touchscreen.

unloadPosition
  Unload position used in the touchscreen.

Command line options
--------------------

Cockpit also takes command line options.  Because these take
precedence over configuration files, they can be used to override
options in the configuration files.  The following command line
options are available:

``--config-file COCKPIT-CONFIG-PATH``
  File path for another cockpit config file.  This option can be
  specified multiple times.  Options defined in later files override
  options in previous ones.

``--no-config-files``
  Skip all configuration files other than those defined via command
  line.  It is equivalent to setting both ``--no-system-config-files``
  and ``--no-user-config-files`` options.

``--no-system-config-files``
  Skip all system-wide configuration files, both cockpit and depot.

``--no-user-config-files``
  Skip the user configuration file, both cockpit and depot.

``--depot-file DEPOT-CONFIG-PATH``
  Filepath for the depot device configuration.  This option can be
  specified multiple times.  If depot files are defined via command
  line, no other depot files will be read, not even those mentioned on
  config files.

``--debug``
  Set the logging level to debug.

.. _cockpit-config-precedence:

Precedence of option values
---------------------------

Cockpit can be configured via multiple config files and command line
options, so the same option may be defined in multiple places.  The
precedence order in such case is:

1. command line option
2. config file set via command line
3. user config file
4. system-wide config files
5. cockpit fallback values

This enables users to have a configuration file that overrides
system-wide settings, or to use command line options for one-off
change of settings.


.. _depot-config:

Depot Configuration
===================

Depot is the collection of devices available to the cockpit program.
Each section of a depot configuration specifies a single device: the
section name being the device name, while the options are the device
configuration.  For example:

.. code:: ini

  [west]
  type: cockpit.devices.microscopeCamera.MicroscopeCamera
  uri: PYRO:WestCamera@127.0.0.1:8001

  [woody]
  type: cockpit.devices.executorDevices.ExecutorDevice
  uri: PYRO:Sheriff@192.168.0.2:8002

  [488nm]
  type: cockpit.devices.microscopeDevice.MicroscopeLaser
  uri: PYRO:Deepstar488Laser@192.168.0.3:7001
  wavelength: 488
  triggerSource: woody
  triggerLine: 1

defines three devices: a camera named "west", an executor named
"woody", and a laser light source named "488nm".  Each device has a
``type`` option which specifies the fully qualified class name of that
device.  Each type will require a different set of options which
should be documented in its class documentation.

In most cases, each device defined in the depot configuration file
corresponds to a Python Microscope device server.  Typical exceptions
are executor devices which do not exist in Python Microscope,
controller devices where each controlled device needs its own section,
and objectives.

Multiple depot configurations
-----------------------------

Like the cockpit configuration, depot configuration may span multiple
files.  Unlike the cockpit configuration where sections with the same
name are merged, each device section must be unique and sections with
the same name will cause an error even if in different files.

In the case of depot files, precedence means what files get read.  If
a set of files is present, the others are not processed.  The order is
as follow:

1. depot files in command line options.
2. depot files in cockpit config files.  If multiple cockpit config
   files define depot files, the list of files is read is the one in
   the file with :ref:`highest precedence
   <cockpit-config-precedence>`.
3. ``depot.conf`` files in :ref:`standard, system-dependent locations
   <default-config-locations>`.


.. _default-config-locations:

Preferences
===========

In addition to the configuration, Cockpit also keeps a cache of user
preferences such as the layout of the different windows, and the last
used experiment and device settings.  These can be cleared via "Reset
User Configuration" on the "Edit" menu.


Location of config files
========================

By default, Cockpit will look for files named ``cockpit.conf`` and
``depot.conf``.  The location of these files are system-dependent:

=======  =================================  ==========================================
OS       System-wide                        User
=======  =================================  ==========================================
Linux    ``/etc/xdg/cockpit/``              ``$HOME/.config/cockpit/``
MacOS    ``/Library/Preferences/cockpit/``  ``~/Library/Application Support/cockpit/``
Windows  ``%ProgramData%\cockpit\``         ``%LocalAppData%\cockpit\``
=======  =================================  ==========================================


.. _config-file-format:

Configuration File Format
=========================

Configuration files are expected in the `INI file format
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`__ as supported by Python's
``configparser``.  In this format, configuration consists of multiple
sections, each named by a ``[section]`` header, followed by key/value
entries.  For example:

.. code:: ini

    [This is the Section Name]
    key: value
    spaces in keys are allowed: and in keys as well

    ; A comment line starts with ";" and is ignored.
    ; It's a good idea to comment configuration files.

    [This is the Name of a second Section]
    multine values: Just start the following lines
        with white space to create multine values.
        The value can span as many lines as you want.
