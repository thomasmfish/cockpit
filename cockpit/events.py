"""Cockpit events module is a topic based publish-subscriber system.

This module is meant as a event passing middleware between the UI,
using :class:`wx.Event`, and the individual devices and handlers which
are independent on wxPython.

In addition to the :class:`Publisher` class, there is a singleton
``Publisher`` instance used throughout the Cockpit program.  The
module functions :func:`publish`, :func:`subscribe`, and
:func:`unsubscribe` are pass-through functions to this singleton.

The global singleton means that any code may subscribe to an event,
such as ``STAGE_POSITION`` or ``CAMERA_ENABLE``.  Likewise any code
may publish an event, along with associated data.  When an event is
published, all subscribers to the event have their functions called.
For example::

    from cockpit import events

    # subscribe obj.on_user_abort so that it is called when the
    # USER_ABORT event is published.
    events.subscribe(events.USER_ABORT,
                     obj.on_user_abort)

    # Publish the CAMERA_ENABLE event as well as the associated data,
    # camera handler and whether it has been enabled or disabled.
    events.publish(events.CAMERA_ENABLE,
                   camera_handler, is_enabled)

Beware
======

While the global singleton can make it easy to solve some problems, it
can be easily abused and leads to situations where it's not clear what
happens when an event is published.

GUI code should not subscribe to events directly and instead should
use :class:`cockpit.gui.EvtEmitter`.  Events between GUI components
should not require this events systems and should instead be using
wx's own event loop.

Available events
================

Anything can be "published".  The following is a list of events that
the system expects.

``CAMERA_ENABLE``

``CLEANUP_AFTER_EXPERIMENT``

``DEVICE_STATUS``

``EXECUTOR_DONE % executor_name``

``EXPERIMENT_COMPLETE``
  The entirety of an experiment has finished execution.

``EXPERIMENT_EXECUTION``
  Some component of the currently-running experiment has finished.

``LIGHT_SOURCE_ENABLE``
  The light source associated with the provided handler has been
  enabled / disabled for taking images.

``MOSAIC_UPDATE``

``NEW_IMAGE % camera name``
  An image has arrived for the camera with the given name.

``PREPARE_FOR_EXPERIMENT``
  An experiment is about to be executed, so devices should prepare
  themselves.

``SETTINGS_CHANGED % deviceor_handler_name``

``STAGE_MOVER``
  A ``StagePositioner`` handler is moving.

``STAGE_POSITION``
  The stage currently is at the specified position.

``STAGE_STOPPED``
  A ``StagePositioner`` handler has stopped moving.

``STAGE_TOP_BOTTOM``

``UPDATE_STATUS_LIGHT``

``USER_ABORT``
  The user clicked on the Abort button.

``VIDEO_MODE_TOGGLE``

``SYNCED_VIEW``
Enabled on camera view images that are synced with zoom/pan to other views. 

``"filter change"``

``"image pixel info"``
  The mouse has moved over a camera view, and the specified
  coordinates have the given value.

``"new site"``
  The user has marked a position as being of interest.

``"objective change"``
  The objective has been changed.

``"site deleted"``
  The specified Site is to be forgotten.

``"soft safety limit"``
  The software-enforced motion limits for the given axis (summing all
  stage-positioner devices) have been changed.

``"stage step index"``
  Which Handler is currently being used to move the stage has been
  changed; the Handlers are arranged in order of maximum range of
  motion.

``"stage step size"``
  The amount of distance the stage will move when the user uses the
  numeric keypad has changed.
